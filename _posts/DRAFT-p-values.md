Who can't relate to this [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/1478)? If I had to guess, "p-value" is probably one of the most commonly used phrases in statistics. However, its frequency of use may have obfuscated its meaning to some extent. What should one say if asked what a p-value means? My first stats course was AP Statistics in high school, and my main takeaway was that it was important when $$p<0.05$$. It wasn't until I got into my PhD that I started to delve into the nuance of what it means.
