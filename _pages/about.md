Hi! I'm interested in regulatory genomics, single-cell, CRISPR, and machine learning. I graduated from the University of Southern California with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering in 2017. From 2019-2020, I worked as a Fulbright Scholar in Berlin, Germany. I speak English, Mandarin and German. See my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LTBrwvIAAAAJ) for my publications, or download my CV [here](https://zrcjessica.github.io/assets/pdf/Resume_Zhou-Jessica.pdf).
