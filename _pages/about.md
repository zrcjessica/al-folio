Hi! I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory working on developing interpretable deep learning models for studying gene regulation. I'm interested in machine learning, statistics, and regulatory genomics. 

I graduated from the University of Southern California with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering in 2017. From 2019-2020, I worked as a Fulbright Scholar in Berlin, Germany. I obtained my PhD in Bioinformatics from the University of California San Diego in 2023. During my time there, I worked on analyzing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data to better understand cocaine addiction, and also developed statistical models for analyzing single-cell CRISPR screens to better understand how enhancers work to regulate gene expression. On my [GitHub](https://github.com/zrcjessica), you can find some pipelines for analysis and simulation of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, as well as some Jupyter notebooks with tutorials for statists and ML concepts.  

I speak English, Mandarin and German. 

Refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=62d3mywAAAAJ) for my publications, or download my CV [here](https://zrcjessica.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_Zhou_Jessica.pdf).
