Hi! I'm interested in regulatory genomics, single-cell sequencing, CRISPR, statistics and machine learning. During my PhD, I have worked on analyzing single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. On my [GitHub](https://github.com/zrcjessica), you can find some pipelines for analysis and simulation of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. I graduated from the University of Southern California with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering in 2017. From 2019-2020, I worked as a Fulbright Scholar in Berlin, Germany. I speak English, Mandarin and German. Refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LTBrwvIAAAAJ) for my publications, or download my CV [here](https://zrcjessica.github.io/assets/pdf/Resume_Zhou-Jessica.pdf).
