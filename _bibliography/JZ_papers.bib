	abstract = {The amygdala contributes to negative emotional states associated with relapse to drug seeking, but the cell type-specific gene regulatory programs that are involved in addiction are unknown. Here we generate an atlas of single nucleus gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the amygdala of outbred rats with low and high cocaine addiction-like behaviors following a prolonged period of abstinence. Between rats with different addiction indexes, there are thousands of cell type-specific differentially expressed genes and these are enriched for molecular pathways including GABAergic synapse in astrocytes, excitatory, and somatostatin neurons. We find that rats with higher addiction severity have excessive GABAergic inhibition in the amygdala, and that hyperpolarizing GABAergic transmission and relapse-like behavior are reversed by pharmacological manipulation of the metabolite methylglyoxal, a GABAA receptor agonist. By analyzing chromatin accessibility, we identify thousands of cell type-specific chromatin sites and transcription factor (TF) motifs where accessibility is associated with addiction-like behaviors, most notably at motifs for pioneer TFs in the FOX, SOX, and helix-loop-helix families.},

	abstract = {Although normally dormant, hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) quickly become activated to divide during a new hair cycle. The quiescence of HFSCs is known to be regulated by a number of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Here we provide several lines of evidence to demonstrate that HFSCs utilize glycolytic metabolism and produce significantly more lactate than other cells in the epidermis. Furthermore, lactate generation appears to be critical for the activation of HFSCs as deletion of lactate dehydrogenase (Ldha) prevented their activation. Conversely, genetically promoting lactate production in HFSCs through mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (Mpc1) deletion accelerated their activation and the hair cycle. Finally, we identify small molecules that increase lactate production by stimulating Myc levels or inhibiting Mpc1 carrier activity and can topically induce the hair cycle. These data suggest that HFSCs maintain a metabolic state that allows them to remain dormant and yet quickly respond to appropriate proliferative stimuli.},
